Homework for Module 2 – VBA scripting

The VBA scripting challenge, I created a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information, I could do the following:
         1. The ticker symbol
         2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
         3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
         4. the total stock volume of the stock.
         5. Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
         6. Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
         7. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

    **Other Considerations**
           Use the sheet “alphabetical_testing.xlsx” while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds.
           
           Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

Finally, my results are uploaded to GitHub:
      1. Screenshots of the results of 4 Worksheets of workbook “Multiple_year_stock_data”
      2. Separate VBA script files  in three parts.
